# Github Optimization

[![Lifecycle:Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/Lifecycle-Experimental-339999)](Redirect-URL)

The goal of this GitHub Optimization Project is to provide tangible progress and recommendations for BC Government that will nurture and grow a healthy, compliant, and vibrant open-source development community. â€‹


## Features

This repository includes the following artifacts developed to understand the repositories in `bcgov` and `BCDevOps` GitHub organizations:

- `grafana-github-plugin`: a forked repository of the official grafana [`github-datasource`](https://github.com/grafana/github-datasource)
- `scripts-go`: a set of golang scripts to collect repository data from GitHub API
- `scripts`: a set of javascript scripts to collect repository data from GitHub API
- `notebook`: [`Jupyter`](https://jupyter.org/) notebook to merge repository data files into the master csv file

## Usage

- `grafana-github-plugin`: For information on setting up the grafana dashboard, please refer to its [README](/grafana-github-plugin/README.md).
- `scripts-go`: To run the go scripts, there are two variables expected, `GITHUB_TOKEN` and `GITHUB_ORG`. The token requires a personal access token
from your github account, and the github organization can be set to an existing organization, e.g. bcgov. To set the tokens, run:

  - `export GITHUB_TOKEN=<your PAT>`
  - `export GITHUB_ORG=<your organization>`

- `scripts`: before running the scripts, follow the .env.example file to add a personal access token.
- `notebook`: run `jupyter notebook` from the notebook directory to launch the notebooks.

## Requirements
